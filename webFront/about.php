    <h1>About DONG Bucket</h1>
    <p>DONG Bucket is a little project that I decided to work on in order to learn web scraping. The web scraping part of the project is written in Python, while the web pages are written in PHP. If you would like to learn more about the technical side of the project here is a link to its <a href="https://github.com/hasahmed/web_scrapping">Github</a> page.
